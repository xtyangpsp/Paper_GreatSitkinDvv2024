## Structure
1. Preprocessing: python scripts for downloading seismic data and computing auto-correlations.
2. dvv_measurement: python scripts and Jupyter notebooks to measure dv/v.
3. dvv_visualization: Jupyter notebooks to plot and visualize the results. This folder contains the computer codes to produce the original figures for the manuscript.
