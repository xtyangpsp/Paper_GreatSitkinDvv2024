## Requirements
The python scripts and Jupyter notebooks need to run using `SeisGo` package, which can be found on https://github.com/xtyangpsp/SeisGo or install with `pip install seisgo`. Details of installing `SeisGo` are available on the GitHub repository page. 

## Structure
1. `Preprocessing`: Python scripts for downloading seismic data and computing auto-correlations.

2. `dvv_results`: python scripts and Jupyter notebooks to measure and plot dv/v. This folder contains the computer codes to produce the original figures for the manuscript.

## Issues
Any issues or questions on the scripts can be reported as an issue.
